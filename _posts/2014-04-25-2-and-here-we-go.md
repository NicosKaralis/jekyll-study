This is my first post on this new development blog. I’ll be using this blog to post information that i find interesting or relevant to my work. I might even write an article or two…

So starting the presentations.

My name is Nicos Karalis, I’m 22 years old and I currently work with development of application and systems to mobile devices, focusing on iOS. I have a brief knowledge in Java and C and I have a broader knowledge in Ruby and Ruby on Rails, including having written a gem to integrate Rails with iOS (pushmeup). Currently I do the course in Computer Science at UFG (Federal University of Goiás) and do internship at Supera Tecnologia.

I had done internship at [Supera Tecnologia][supera_tecnologia] where I did work on many technologies, including:
 
* Lotus Notes
* XPages
* @Formula
* Java
* Ruby on Rails
* Php
* iOS

The reason I’m creating this blog is to organize and promote my work. I already have some knowledge in developing for iOS and now I want to write applications for Mac OS too. Here I’ll post things related to web development and application development for iOS and Mac OS. Especially related to what I’m working on.

Taking advantage of this space also intend to train my English too. And so I’ll try to write two posts, one in Portuguese and one in English.

Well, basically this is all for an introduction. We’ll talk more soon. :)
